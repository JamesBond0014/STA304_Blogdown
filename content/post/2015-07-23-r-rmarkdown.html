<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>There are millions of dollars provided by the city of Toronto. By analyzing
the how grants were distributed to different organizations throughout the city of
Toronto, patterns of distribution patterns emerged. The city of Toronto consistently
prioritizes programs such as Toronto Foundation of Student Success through the Student
Nutrition program, as well as other organizations. Increase in total funding allocated
every year did not create a more diverse range of city funding.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>City funding is always a major point of contention every year as the city struggles to fund various programs and organizations all vying for more funding. The City of Toronto approves more and more community grants in order to fund to tackle issues such as community involvement, poverty, diversity and inclusion. I found that the city allocates a majority of annual community grants towards a select few organizations.</p>
<p>By breaking down the funding distribution to gain an insight on which group benefits the most from the increased grants. It was found that as more funds are made available, a select few organizations such as the Toronto Foundation for Student Success gain an overwhelming portion of the new funds. Close to 43% of city funding in 2019 was given to just 20 of over 800 qualifying applicants.
This blog will go through a brief overview of the data followed by analysis of individual graphs as well as an overall analysis. However this blog lacks depth due to inconsistent data set formats, which will be improved in future editions.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Every year, the city of Toronto allocates tens of millions of dollars to support the various organizations throughout the city in order to enhance the living experience of its citizens. As a member of one of these organizations who vies city grants every year, I know the competitive and lengthy process of obtaining even a few hundred of the millions of dollars given out every year. Luckily, the city of Toronto provided detailed and informative data sets regarding where the money is sent out to every year. The data is mostly complete with negligible pieces of data missing. I was able to filter those data out without dramatically altering the outcome of my graphs.</p>
<p>Taking a quick look through the top 20 receivers of grants for the last 9 years, it is interesting to note that the top 20 beneficiaries of Toronto City community grants are frequently the same few organizations. Organizations such as Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Toronto International Film Festival Inc(TIFF), Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Carabana) and Toronto Foundation for Student Success are almost among the top receivers among over 800 organizations to receive these grants every year. Furthermore, every year with the exception of 2019, Toronto Foundation for Student Success has lead the received amount by a significant amount. In 2019, the leader was Angel Foundation for Learning. Both these organizations received money from the Student Nutrition Program.

<p>Next I looked through the total funding that was approved by the city of Toronto every year, along with the total money received by the top 20 receivers. As expected, the general trend of the total funding is mimicked by the funding given to the top 20 organizations. However, there is a much steeper increase in the funding towards the top 20 organizations compared to the total funding given out ever year. The total funding given rose over 50 percent between 2010 to 2019, from roughly 43 million dollars to almost 69 million dollars. Despite the impressive increase, the amount of money the top 20 organizations received rose from 15 million dollars to almost 30 million dollars, alomst a 100 percent increase in funding over 9 years.</p>

To investigate further, I looked into the percent break down of the funding each year. I analyzed how much percent the top 20 organizations receive in comparison the total amount of funds granted every year. Similar to the conclusions drawn in the graph previously. In 2010, the top 20 companies received 33 percent of all the funds, and while a lot, in 2019 those funds rose to 43 percent of all the funds.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
Lastly, I quickly graphed all the amount of organizations that received the funding. Throughout the past 10 years, there were around 800 organizations that received funding every year.</p>

<div id="discusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discusion</h1>
<p>The graphs showed a trend that as city increased funding, a significant portion of the increased funding went towards programs and organizations that already receive a significant portion of the grants. Almost all of the organizations in the top 20 list are well known and generally appreciated throughout the city, including a wide variety of arts programs, cultural festivities and youth support, supporting the cities push for diversity and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>The city shows favor towards a few organizations by allocating a significant portion of the funds to these organizations every year. As the city increases the budget for the annual community grants, the increases goes towards more funding towards the well funded programs instead of newer programs, as the city has not significantly increased the number of organizations they fund every year. Despite well over 50 million dollars of funding being rejected in 2015 (City of Toronto, 2016), the city of Toronto has not made an attempt to provide the these organizations with grants.</p>
<p>Summarizing the various graphs, while the city provides a lot of funds to that certainly help out many communities, the city provides by far the most money through the Student Nutrition Program through 2 organizations; the Angel Foundation for Learning (the main beneficiary in 2019) and the Toronto Foundation for Student Success (main beneficiary through 2010-2018). The heavy emphasis on these funding through the past 10 years show that these believes are widely supported by the city, and are irrelevant to the reigning members of city council.</p>

<h1>Weaknesses and next steps</h1>
<p>The data sets between each year is slightly different, making comparing data between each year difficult and time consuming. Due to the issue, some more in depth analysis could not be done, such as grant distribution by ward or by funding programs. Next steps would be modifying the data sets in order to create meaningful graphs and analyze interesting trends regarding wards.</p>
